1. Profiling!
2. Testing!
3. Make sure Numeric[A] is a superset of other type classes
4. Make sure Number contains functionality for all types
5. Add support for Rational and Complex to Number
6. Improve macro support so we don't need operator -> methodname mapping
7. Create our own BigFloat/Decimal class(es)
8. Match up concrete and generic APIs
9. Unify operators (e.g. /~, %, /%, **, etc).
10. Make sure situations with implicits is coherent
11. Make sure Rig/Ring/AdditiveGroup/MultiplicativeMonoid are all sane/OK
12. Make sure specialization is consistent
13. More benchmarks
