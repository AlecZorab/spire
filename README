This is a library intended to support fast, generic math in Scala. It also
adds some new number types (Complex[T], Rational, etc.).

It began life as a series of proposed changes. At this point the hope is to
create a useful stand-alone library and only lobby for changes to the Scala's
core library/language that are either uncontroversial, or which enable better
performance.

It's a work in progress, primarily by Tom Switzer and Erik Osheim.
